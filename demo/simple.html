        <p><a href="../" target="_blank">SqueakJS</a> is a Virtual Machine
        for the Squeak dialect of Smalltalk, written in pure JavaScript by Vanessa Freudenberg.
        Above is a stripped-down version of Squeak 2.2, which was released in 1998.
        Modern Squeak versions are much more advanced, but more demanding, too. You can try
        them on the SqueakJS <a href="../run">launcher page</a>.
        Also, you may want to try the <a href= "https://smalltalkzoo.thechm.org/HOPL-Squeak.html?mini">Lively SqueakJS Debugger</a>.
