SqueakJS: A Squeak VM for the Web and Node.js
=============================================

SqueakJS is an HTML5 runtime engine for [Squeak][squeak]</a> Smalltalk written in pure JavaScript. It also works for many other OpenSmalltalk-compatible images.

Embedding a Smalltalk application in your webpage can be as simple as:

    SqueakJS.runSqueak(imageUrl, canvas, { fullscreen: true });

The interpreter core is divided in a number of `vm.*.js` modules, internal plugins in `vm.plugins.*.js` modules and external plugins in the "plugins" directory. The Just-in-Time compiler is optional ("jit.js") and can be easily replaced with your own.

There are a number of interfaces:
* browser: the regular HTML interface lets you use SqueakJS on your own web page. Just include "squeak.js".
* headless browser: a headless VM. It lets you use SqueakJS in your browser without a direct UI (you can create your own UI with a plugin). Include "squeak_headless.js" and add an "imageName" parameter to your website URL (eg. https://example.com/my/page.html?imageName=./example.image) or call the Javascript function "fetchImageAndRun('https://example.com/my/example.image')" to start the specified image.
* Node.js: another headless VM. It lets you use SqueakJS as a Node.js application. Just run "node squeak_node.js <image name>".

For discussions, please use the [vm-dev mailing list][vm-dev]. Also, please visit the [project home page][homepage]!

Running it
----------
**Simplest**

* [Run a minimal image][mini]. This is the simple demo included in this repo.
* Or run [Etoys][etoys]. Everything except the image and template files is in this repo.
* Or similarly, [Scratch][scratch], also in here.

**Run your own Squeak image in the browser**

* Drag an image from your local files into the [launcher][run].
* ... and all the other demo pages (see above) accept dropped images, too.

**Run your own Squeak image from the command line**

* Install a recent version of Node.js
* Run example image: `node squeak_node.js headless/headless.image`

**Run an interactive shell based on WebSocket communication with Cuis image**

* Install a recent version of Node.js
* Go to [ws][ws] and execute `start_server.sh` in a first shell and `start_client.sh` in a second shell.
* After initialization it should be possible to issue Smalltalk statements which will be executed in the Smalltalk image.
* Try commands like: `Object allSubclasses size` `1837468731248764723 * 321653125376153761` `Collection allSubclasses collect: [ :c | c name ]`

**Which Browser**

All modern browsers should work (Chrome, Safari, IE, FireFox), though Chrome performs best currently. Safari on iPad works somewhat. YMMV.
Fixes to improve browser compatibility are highly welcome!

If your browser does not support ES6 modules try the full or headless SqueakJS VM as a single file (aka bundle) in the [Distribution][dist] directory.


Installing locally
------------------
* download and unpack the [ZIP archive][zip] (or clone the [github repo][repo])
* serve the SqueakJS directory using a local web server.

  TIP: If you have python try out something like
  ```
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090
  ```
* in your web browser, open the SqueakJS/demo/simple.html file

Now Squeak should be running.
The reason for having to run from a web server is because the image is loaded with an XMLHttpRequest which does not work with a file URL. Alternatively, you could just open SqueakJS/run/index.html and drop in a local image.

Using (self contained) bundled files
------------------------------------
* select your preferred type of interface (browser or headless)
* use the appropriate file (`squeak_bundle.js` resp. `squeak_headless_bundle.js`) from the [Distribution][dist] directory

How to modify it
----------------
* use any text editor
* you have to reload the page for your changes to take effect

How to share your changes
-------------------------
* easiest for me is if you create a [pull request][pullreq]
* otherwise, send me patches

Contributions are very welcome!

Things to work on
-----------------
SqueakJS is intended to run any Squeak image. It can already load any image from the original 1996 Squeak release to the latest Cog-Spur release, including 64-bit and Sista variants. But various pieces (primitives in various plugins) are still missing, in particular media support (MIDI, 3D graphics). Also, we should make pre-Spur 64 bit images load, and add a JIT for SISTA bytecodes. And, it would be nice to make it work on as many browsers as possible, especially on mobile touch devices.

As for optimizing I think the way to go is an optimizing JIT compiler. The current JIT is very simple and does not optimize at all. Since we can't access or manipulate the JavaScript stack, we might want that compiler to inline as much as possible, but keep the call sequence flat so we can return to the browser at any time. Even better (but potentially more complicated) is actually using the JavaScript stack, just like Eliot's Stack VM uses the C stack. I have done some [advanced JIT mockups][jit]. To make BitBlt fast, we could probably use WebGL.

To make SqueakJS useful beyond running existing Squeak images, we should use the JavaScript bridge to write a native HTML UI which would certainly be much faster than BitBlt.

Better Networking would be interesting, too. The SocketPlugin currently does allows HTTP(S) requests and WebSockets. How about implementing low level Socket support based on HTTP-tunneling? The VM can run in a WebWorker. How about parallelizing the VM with WebWorkers?

There's a gazillion exciting things to do :)
